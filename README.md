## Some notes
1\. Acceleration by Ray: 

Due to the need of repeated simulations, we use the distributed execution engine **Ray** to accelerate the fitting and save the experiment time. 
As a result, you may find the following code at the beginning of these main files:

```
import ray
ray.init(num_cpus=NUM_CPU, num_gpus=NUM_GPU)
res = ray.get(FUNCTION_TO_BE_PARALLELED)
```

2\. Detail about the SimpleMDP:

The SimpleMDP is borrowed from [[Wainwright 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06265)]. See Section 3.4 and Figure 1 therein. 


3\. Online statistical procedure for Q-Learning:

Once we establish the functional central limit theorem for the partial-sum process (Theorem 3.1 in our paper), we can apply Algorithm 1 in [[Lee et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03156)] to compute the pivotal statistic.

4\. Considered algorithms:

We consider two algorithms. One is the averaged Q learning (named as "aql" in the code), while the other is the entropy regularized variant (named as "entropy" in the code).
